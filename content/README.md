# Content Directory

This directory will be sync'd in to the virtual machine's web root and used to store installed theme and plugin files, as well as to store uploaded media.

The contents of this directory are git-ignore'd: if you want to branch your own project off of this base, simply remove that line from the `.gitignore` file
