# WPAPI Vagrant Varietal

This is a Vagrant configuration for rapidly spinning up a [WordPress REST API](https://github.com/wp-api/wp-api)-enabled WP instance within a local virtual machine. As the name indicates, this project was inspired by [VVV](https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/vvv/tree), but is a completely new VM configuration using [Ansible]() for provisioning (with a little help borrowed from the Roots team's [trellis](https://github.com/roots/trellis) WP environment management tools).

## Getting Started

Run the following terminal command from within the repository folder:

```
vagrant up
```
