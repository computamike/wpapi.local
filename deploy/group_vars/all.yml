sites:
  # Public Path == the web root of the site in the VM.
  # FQDN == fully-qualified domain name. The fqdn settings should match the
  # vagrant config.hostsupdater.aliases settings: because nginx checks this
  # value against the URL being requested, it must be the same as the
  # server's DNS name.
  # Slug == the string used for the database name for each WP installation
  # in the VM, as well as the ___.conf name of the site's nginx config.
